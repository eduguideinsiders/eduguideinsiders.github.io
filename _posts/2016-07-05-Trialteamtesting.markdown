## Overview

### About Teams

When teachers implement the EduGuide platform in their classrooms, they typically will use our Teams feature to manage their students. From within their team, a teacher can add/remove students, monitor students' progress in a path, and communicate with their students. When there is more than one teacher on a team, the teachers can also communicate with each other from within the team.

Students will become members of the team, but they will not be able to  view the team pages. Instead, they are automatically taken into their personal path where they will complete their daily or weekly activity.

### About Paths

Another feature used by teachers is our Path system. A path is a series of online lessons, or activities, which are delivered to students on a daily basis. Each activity can contain different types of media such as text, video, and images. Often, students are asked to respond to questions which prompt them to think about the topic or concepts they are learning about.

### Trial Teams

The Trial Team is a limited version of our Team feature. A trial team subscription lasts for 90 days, and includes the first five activities from the path. Trial teams are also limited to 50 members, so they can be just big enough for one classroom.
